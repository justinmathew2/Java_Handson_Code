   Develop a Menu driven java application to demonstrate the Movie Ticket Booking operations using classes and objects, array of objects as per the following.
   
   	Create a class called “Movie” with attributes such as movieId, movieName, theatreName, noOfTickets, ticketCost and add the necessary constructor, setter/getter methods.
   
   	Perform the following ticket booking operations with Menu driven options.
   
		o Add Movie Details.

		o Search Movie details for given movieId.

		o Book Ticket and display the ticket details.

4. Employee Payroll System Using Inheritance (Explanation Video Link- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxaP30kRfBs )

	Write a menu driven application to maintain the employee payroll details using Java to demonstrate the concept of Inheritance. Assume that a company contains Permanent Employee and Contract Employee for whom the salary calculation varies. Your application must contain the following functionalities along with the use of method overriding, and super keyword.

	a. For each employee your application must have the details such as name, empid, department, designation, experience, basicPay, DA, gradePay, personalPay, iTax, professionalTax, epf
	
	b. Get the employee details from user
	
	c. Display the Employee Pay Slip for the month of January 2016 with all details in a proper and neat format.
	
	d. Give personalPay Rs. 2000 for all the permanent employee and Rs. 1000 for contract employee

5. Inheritance (Explanation Video Link-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFUbNDcLQjQ )

	Create an abstract class called Shape in pkg1, Square and Rectangle classes in pkg2, Triangle and Circle classes in pkg3. Classes in pkg2 and pkg3 inherit Shape class. Import the necessary packages in a Test class which contains a menu driven program to calculate the area of various shapes.

6. Interfaces (Explanation Video Link-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqomPFwVGJE&list=PL2ARJYFJqbcImMxZ0lOblv4a-9nBZrstY&index=7)

	Create an interface called Library which contains the functions such as ReturnBook, BorrowBook, and Display. Create Student class and Faculty class both of which implements the Library interface. Use necessary class members such as regno, name, department, no_books, etc. Perform menu driven operations like CreateStudent, CreateFaculty, ReturnBook, BorrowBook and Display from a Main class.

	Note: You should use array of objects
